### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am currently working on building a smart hotel booking marketplace @[FindHotel]. Check our [blog] to find out more, and consider [joining us]! 

Before joining FindHotel I worked as a researcher at [Tampere University](https://www.tuni.fi/en/about-us/tampere-university), in Tampere, Finland, and at the [Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience](https://nin.nl/), in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. If you are interested on my past research you can take a look at my [ResearchGate] and [Google Scholar] profiles. Or if you have a lot of spare time you could read my [doctoral thesis].

If you want to contact me, drop me an [email], or reach out in [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/germangh)!
